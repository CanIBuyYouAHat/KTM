(Kanban Task Manager)

Organizational "To-Do" board in the well-known Kanban style, allowing for tasks to be moved around and ordered.

Built as an exercise in using React within the Next.Js framework, an exploration into Redux state management, and a solid introduction to Google Cloud Platform with Firebase. Boards can be created as groups of tasks with each subtask appearing as a card within that column.
